## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Multi-select on canvas** — Shift+click plants/pipes to toggle selection; Shift+drag on empty backdrop draws a marquee box to select all plants inside; ⌘/Ctrl+A selects all plants.
- **Batch operations** — drag any selected plant to move the whole selection together (relative positions preserved); Delete/Backspace removes all selected plants and pipes at once.
- **First-load auto-fit** — the canvas auto-fits to all plants on first load so new users never see a blank board.
- **Viewport persistence** — pan/zoom state persists per graph in localStorage; refreshing or dispatching a new run no longer resets the viewport.

### Changed
- Left-drag on empty backdrop in select mode now pans the canvas (was marquee); marquee selection moved to Shift+drag.
- Removed unused `reset()` method from canvas store (the "适应" button's fit-to-bounds replaces it).

### Fixed
- Marquee selection coordinates now convert from viewport (SVG viewBox) space to content (graph) space, matching node x/y.
- Multi-select drag now snapshots selected node IDs at drag start, avoiding stale React closure state after a Shift+click toggle.
- Marquee selection now uses window-level pointer events (instead of React synthetic events + pointer capture on inner `<rect>`), preventing the selection rectangle from sticking to the cursor when pointerup is dropped.
- Added `pointercancel` listener so macOS trackpad gestures / system interruptions clean up the marquee instead of leaving it stuck.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-26

### Added
- **4.5 Multimodal** — `ContentPart` (text + image) across engine, providers, and canvas.
- **4.7 Human-in-the-loop** — gate approve / edit / reject / scrap with run-halt webhook.
- **4C.7 Plugin process isolation** — `child_process.fork` with env trimming and fetch/fs proxy allowlists.
- **4D.7 MCP remote transports** — `stdio` / `http` / `sse` servers and tool-call permission governance.
- **4.9 Engineering**
  - GitHub Actions CI (typecheck + build + test) and gitleaks secret-leak scan.
  - CORS restricted to `CORS_ORIGINS` (was allow-all) plus basic security response headers.
  - Dockerfile + `docker-compose.yml` deployment.
  - MIT `LICENSE`.

### Changed
- CORS now requires `CORS_ORIGINS` in shared deployments; local dev keeps allow-all when unset.
